## About this project

This project is a cloned instagram user profile for NevDev webstack challenge. Features are - the user can edit his/her name and bio, upload images, delete one or all images, display images, change profile picture.... Yeah just simple but i learnt alot from it, it's also responsive. Its been a challenging one but I'm glad that I did it; atleast I used it to learn React JS. Basically, i learnt how CRUD works using React JS, how to store data on local storage using Dexie library and how to make app work offline (without internet) with workbox.

## Stack

For this project, I used the following:\
1.HTML\
2.CSS\
3.JavaScript\
4.IndexedDb/Dexie for storage\
5.Workbox for service worker generation
